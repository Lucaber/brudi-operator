# brudi-operator
The brudi-operator is a Helm-based kubernetes operator for the [`brudi`](https://github.com/mittwald/brudi) backup tool. It offers easy control of `brudi` in your kubernetes-cluster via custom `backup` and `restore` resources, which can be sued to shedule backups at regular intervals or restore them if needed, with the operator handling the specifics such as cron and container creation.
